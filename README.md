First draft at an updated ubuntu based ope container

This is the first cut at creating a template from which other ope book containers can be built

Right now it has everything it for the Under the Covers: The Secret Life of Software.  In time
we will strip things out so that it really is just a base template that can be use for generic books.

The usage is all driven the makefile.  Will needd to test and add documentation.
